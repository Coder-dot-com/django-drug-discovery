Ai drug discovery based on targe. Categorise targets (human targets categorised based on target organ) Other groups viral, bacterial,fungal, protozoa, then type of the organism e.g. Staphlyococcus aureus and then receptor
e.g. Bacterial->Staphylococcus aureus -> XYZ receptor

Ai drug gneration based on list of compounds (smiles)

-checkbox to predict ic50 ec50 Ki etc... greyed out if not enough data available for the target receptor and corresponding prediction choice
-and also calculate various other metrics e.g. lipinskis rule of 5

Offtarget effects/toxicity
(human only) 


admet(absorption dsitribution etc..) prediction model


Generate ---- Predict (Ic50 etc.., ADMET break down toxicity into type e.g. hepatotoxicity, off target effects) ----(Analyse, lipinskis rule of 5 and other calculations) --- (later on Modify/ligand binding/tweak compound ability)
